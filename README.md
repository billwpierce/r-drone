# R-Drone
R is an autostabilizing drone that, once it's finished, will hopefully be documented. Regardless of whether or not that happens, R aims to be completely open source and easy to make, while still teaching the basics of quadcopter development.

## Setup

### Code
###### Note: It is assumed that by this step, you already have put together and wired the robot.
1. Open `terminal`
2. `cd` into where you want the code to appear.
3. Make sure you have git (if you do not, instructions can be found [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)).
4. Type into terminal `git clone https://github.com/billwpierce/r-drone.git`. Hit enter.
5. Find the directory where your code is, and double click on the 'auto-stabilization' file.
6. Attach an arduino and upload the code!
7. Now run the drone.

*WARNING*: Whoever turns on the drone is to be held responsible for all damages or liabilities from the drone including, but not limited to broken property, explosions, death, etc. Flying drones is inherently dangerous, especially when powered by Lithium Polymer or "LiPo" batteries.
